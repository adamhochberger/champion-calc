# Champion Calculator for League of Legends

## by Adam Hochberger

This calculator will implement different class structures to fully model champions and will be continually modified to equate more complex structures.

The class structure will first be implemented using components to model individual attributes of abilities, creating a modular approach to adding to champion designs.
This was achieved through Python dictionaries that have references to data (less bulky than individual objects).

Once there is a decent structure in place, I will pull information from online resources and initialize Champion objects that will be pushed into a database.

The end goal of this project is to utilize a web interface that will pull from the database and allow manipulation of the different objects.
